 ### Bugs 

am I responsive [website](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://sm-kingdom-8e52019dc777.herokuapp.com/) for deployed project doesn't return the deployed webpage, however the generator works fine with the local build. 
This issue has been checked by CI student technical support team and they were not able to explain the behaviour and assist with fixing it, so the screenshot fpr am I responsive has been done using the locally deployed app. 

 ### Solved bugs
    - When users were trying to register the page was returning error 500, that was fixed by adding ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION as none. 
    - Bug was present when adding prints to the shopping bag no print option can be selected.
    - Bug when adding prints of the same print option but different size was overwritting the existing entry 
    - Bug when in the bag view increasing or decreasing number of items would give for prints a new entry that is set to null and is connected to the original entry. 

## Validator Testing 

- HTML 
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
    - Every page has been checked and no errors or warnings have been highlighted. 
- CSS 
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/).

    ![CSS Validator](static/assets/cssvalidator.jpg)

- Accessibility
    - I confimed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse, however the google extension was blocked by my company both in Google and Firefox, so had to use [online tool](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/231003_AiDcGV_AYH/#PWA), my internet at home is not that fast, so I elieve this is affecting the performance speed. 

    ![Accessibility](media/lighthouse_report.jpg)
- JS 
    - No errors were found using [jshint validator](https://jshint.com/)

- Python Validation
    Was used using python3 -m flake8 command in the terminal
    Present errors: 
    - E501 line too long - left on purpose as not dangerous for the code
    - F401 - 'checkout.signals' imported but unused - this import is required for stripe payment to work
    - F841 local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used - required for error catching 
    - F401 'env' imported but unused - required for env variable in local build 
    - F811 redefinition of unused 'handler404' from line 5 - required for 404 custom page in the live app. 

## Manual Testing

- Every page has been manually tested:
    - Screen resize on different devices 
    - Making sure everything is visible and does not look out of place 
    - Validation tools has been used during testing as per the chapter above. 
    - What has been tested: 
        - Functionality: every element is functioning as expected. 
        - User-friendly: easy and clear navigation
        - bug-free: no bugs were found during the final testing on prod
        - security: as this is a moch webpage, real live payment stripe varification is not set, but mock works as expected. 
        - performance: the application renders fast, works accross different browsers ( Chrome, firefox, explorer) and devices (laptop, ipad, iphone), the wev application is accessable anywhere anytime.
